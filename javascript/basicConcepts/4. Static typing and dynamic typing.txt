Which provides what and which type JS uses.?

Static Typing

    Definition: In a statically typed language, the type of a variable is known at compile time. This means that variables are explicitly declared with a type and cannot change their type later.
    How It Works: If you try to assign a value of a different type to an already defined variable, you will get a compilation error.

Dynamic Typing

    Definition: In a dynamically typed language, the type of a variable is known at runtime. This means you can assign different types of values to the same variable during the execution of a program.
    How It Works: You don't need to declare a variable with a specific type. The interpreter determines the type of the variable based on the assigned value.
