What is immediately invoked javascript functions?

IFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that is executed as soon as it is defined. It's a way to create a function and immediately invoke it without explicitly calling it later. This pattern helps create a new scope and isolate variables from the surrounding scope, making it useful for avoiding variable collisions and managing private data.


Example:

(function() {
  console.log("This is an IIFE and it runs immediately!");
})();
