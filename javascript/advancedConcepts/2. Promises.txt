A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation in JavaScript. It provides a cleaner, more intuitive way to work with asynchronous code compared to traditional callbacks, reducing "callback hell" and improving readability.
1. Promise States

A promise can be in one of three states:

    Pending: Initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
    Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully, and the promise has a value.
    Rejected: The operation failed, and the promise has a reason for failure (an error).

2. Creating a Promise

A Promise object takes a function as its argument, which receives two parameters: resolve (to indicate successful completion) and reject (to indicate failure).

Example:

const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  let success = true; // Simulate success/failure

  if (success) {
    resolve('Operation successful!');
  } else {
    reject('Operation failed!');
  }
});

// Consuming the promise
myPromise
  .then((value) => {
    console.log(value); // This runs if resolve() is called
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error); // This runs if reject() is called
  });

3. then and catch Methods

    then() is used to specify what happens when a promise is resolved (fulfilled). It takes a callback function that receives the promise's result.
    catch() is used to handle errors when a promise is rejected. It takes a callback function that receives the error reason.

Example:

const fetchData = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    const dataLoaded = true;
    if (dataLoaded) {
      resolve('Data loaded successfully!');
    } else {
      reject('Failed to load data.');
    }
  }, 2000);
});

fetchData
  .then((data) => {
    console.log(data); // Output after 2 seconds: "Data loaded successfully!"
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error); // Output if rejected: "Failed to load data."
  });



finally() Method

The finally() method is used to specify a piece of code that runs regardless of whether the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

Example:

fetchData
  .then((data) => {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
  })
  .finally(() => {
    console.log('Operation complete.'); // Runs regardless of outcome
  });



Common Use Cases for Promises

    Fetching data from an API: Promises are commonly used with fetch() to make network requests.

fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
  });

Handling asynchronous operations like file reading, database access, etc. in Node.js.

Promises represent the completion or failure of an asynchronous task and are a more elegant solution than callbacks.
then(), catch(), and finally() provide a structured way to handle asynchronous code.
Methods like Promise.all() and Promise.race() offer ways to work with multiple promises concurrently.
